# 📦 DataSense Python Project 4: Event Planner & Guest Manager

## Objective

The goal of this project is to help you **apply Python fundamentals** in a real-world scenario using clean code and proper database integration. By the end, you will demonstrate:

- `print()` / `input()`
- Type conversion & validation
- Data structures: `list`, `tuple`, `dictionary`, `set`
- **Loops (for/while)** and **nested loops**
- **List comprehension**
- **Nested data handling**
- PostgreSQL integration using `psycopg2`

## ❓ Problem Statement

You’ve been hired by a growing event company to automate their **event and guest tracking process**. Your task is to build a command-line application that:

- Manages multiple events
- Handles multiple guests for each event
- Prevents duplicates
- Stores all data in a PostgreSQL database

But beyond basic functionality, the company wants a **robust solution**:
- Use of **loops** and **list comprehensions** to generate reports and summaries
- Handle **nested guest data structures**
- Efficient and reusable logic
